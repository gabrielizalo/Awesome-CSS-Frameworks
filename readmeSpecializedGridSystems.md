Responsive, fully customizable & mobile first CSS flexbox grid framework 
/ system based on Sass (SCSS), which you never seen before. The main 
reason that I wrote yet another grid system, was the fact that I can't 
found any grid system, which would give me the possibility to create 
functional grid in short time... unlimitedGrid is a collection of 
~~functions~~ principles and rules, by which you can easily and fast 
create an attractive and (ultra) functional grids.
