The 960 Grid System is an effort to streamline web development workflow 
by providing commonly used dimensions, based on a width of 960 pixels. 
There are two variants: 12 and 16 columns, which can be used separately 
or in tandem. The premise of the system is ideally suited to rapid 
prototyping, but it would work equally well when integrated into a 
production environment. There are printable sketch sheets, design 
layouts, and a CSS file that have identical measurements.

Responsive, fully customizable & mobile first CSS flexbox grid framework 
/ system based on Sass (SCSS), which you never seen before. The main 
reason that I wrote yet another grid system, was the fact that I can't 
found any grid system, which would give me the possibility to create 
functional grid in short time... unlimitedGrid is a collection of 
~~functions~~ principles and rules, by which you can easily and fast 
create an attractive and (ultra) functional grids.
